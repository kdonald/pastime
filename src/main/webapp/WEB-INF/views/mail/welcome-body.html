Thank you for your interest in Pastime.
As founder, I'd like to take this opportunity to share more about what we're working on and how you can help us reach our goals.<br/>
<br/>
We have a vision where you can go on-line, discover quality leagues for the sports you love, connect with players who share your passion, form teams, and then get out and play.
We believe you should be able to do this with ease, without standing in a line or getting bogged down in paperwork.
We will be working hard to ensure you never miss opportunities to compete simply because you were unaware of them or you didn't have a team to play on.
In addition, we will provide you with the tools you need to excel as a teammate, to capture and share each moment, and to learn from each performance.
Above all, our goal is to create an environment where teams flourish, lifelong friendships are forged, and we all have more time to spend doing what we love.<br/>
<br/>
You can help us realize this vision by simply telling your friends about us and asking them to subscribe.
<strong>Please help us spread the word!</strong><br/>
